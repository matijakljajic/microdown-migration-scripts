# Microdown Migration Scripts

This repo contains shell scripts designed to assist in migrating documents from `.md` to `.md2` so that they can be used by Foliage without Pillar.

Don't forget to `chmod +x process-md.sh` so that everything functions normally.

Every script has a useful `--help` command you can rely on to get started.
